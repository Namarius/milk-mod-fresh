# Milk Mod Fresh

This is a Mod for Skyrim AE (also known as 1.6).
Currenty it's only a proof of concept for it's inner workings.
Nothing is stable.
Mayor changes can happen at any commit.
FormId are not fixed in place.

To build this you need some dependencies:
 * [JContainers](https://github.com/ryobg/JContainers)
 * [Bodyslide-Preset-Reader](https://github.com/Gaz-tec/Bodyslide-Preset-Reader)
 * [SkyUI](https://github.com/schlangster/skyui)
 * [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080)
 * [PapyrusUtil SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048)
 * [ConsoleUtilSSE NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649)

I use [pyro](https://github.com/fireundubh/pyro) with [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Papyrus for Vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joelday.papyrus-lang-vscode) for development.
The folder structure is a bit different than most other mods.
It's easier for me to work like this.

## Planned/Working features

 * Milk-Production
 * Milking
 * Value-Based Bodymorphing
 * Extension system

## Non planned features
 * Anything that is not directly bound to the handling of actor states and values and animations.
 This includes: Economy, Addiction, Interaction, Dialoges etc.
